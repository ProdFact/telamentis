# ðŸ“œ TelaMentis Governance Model

This document outlines the governance model for the TelaMentis project, including its licensing, stewardship, decision-making processes, and roles within the community. Our goal is to foster an open, collaborative, and sustainable environment for the project's growth and success.

## 1. Licensing

*   **Project License**: TelaMentis is licensed under the **MIT License**.
    *   This is a permissive, business-friendly open-source license that allows for maximum freedom in usage.
    *   It allows for free use, modification, and distribution, including for commercial purposes.
    *   A copy of the license can be found in the `LICENSE` file in the project root.
*   **Documentation License**: Documentation is covered by the MIT License as well. This ensures consistency across all project materials.

## 2. Project Stewardship & Structure

*   **Initial Phase (Pre-Beta / Beta)**:
    *   The project will initially be stewarded by its founding maintainers and core contributors under a designated GitHub organization (e.g., `TelaMentisOrg` - replace with actual).
    *   Decisions will be made by consensus among the active maintainers.
*   **Post-Beta / 1.0 Phase (Maturation)**:
    *   **Steering Committee**: As the project matures and the community grows (typically around or after the Beta release), a formal Steering Committee (SC) will be established.
        *   **Responsibilities**: Guiding the overall project direction, resolving disputes, managing project resources (if any), and upholding the project's mission and values.
        *   **Composition**: The SC will consist of elected representatives from the contributor community, including maintainers and active community members. The election process will be defined and documented before the first election.
        *   **Term Limits**: SC members will serve for fixed terms (e.g., 1-2 years) to ensure rotation and fresh perspectives.
*   **Long-Term Vision (Potential Foundation)**:
    *   If the project achieves significant adoption and community size, consideration will be given to moving TelaMentis under the stewardship of a neutral, non-profit open-source foundation (e.g., Linux Foundation, Apache Software Foundation, or a dedicated TelaMentis Foundation). This would ensure long-term sustainability, vendor neutrality, and legal protection.

## 3. Decision-Making Process

TelaMentis aims for a transparent and meritocratic decision-making process.

*   **General Changes (Bug Fixes, Minor Features, Docs)**:
    *   Discussed via GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.
    *   Typically require at least one approving review from a maintainer or designated module owner before merging.
    *   Consensus is preferred, but maintainers have the final say for their respective areas if consensus cannot be easily reached.
*   **Significant Changes (New Features, Architectural Modifications, API Breaking Changes)**:
    *   **RFC (Request for Comments) Process**:
        1.  **Proposal**: A contributor (or maintainer) opens an RFC issue on GitHub, detailing the proposed change, motivation, design, alternatives, and potential impact. A template may be provided.
        2.  **Discussion**: The proposal is discussed by the community. Maintainers and relevant experts will provide feedback.
        3.  **Consensus Building**: The goal is to reach a rough consensus on the direction of the RFC.
        4.  **Approval/Rejection**: The Steering Committee (once formed) or lead maintainers will make a final decision on the RFC based on the discussion and alignment with project goals. For highly contentious issues, a vote among SC members or maintainers might be held.
        5.  **Implementation**: Once an RFC is approved, work can begin on implementing it.
*   **Roadmap Planning**:
    *   The project roadmap (see [roadmap.md](./ROADMAP.md)) will be developed collaboratively, with input solicited from the community via GitHub Issues and discussions.
    *   The Steering Committee (or lead maintainers) will be responsible for prioritizing and ratifying the roadmap.

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities

*   **Users**: Individuals or organizations using TelaMentis. Their feedback is crucial for guiding development.
*   **Contributors**: Anyone who contributes to the project (code, documentation, tests, issue reports, community support).
    *   Contributions are recognized and valued. Active contributors may be invited to become Reviewers or Maintainers.
*   **Reviewers**: Trusted contributors who have demonstrated expertise in specific areas of the codebase or project.
    *   **Responsibilities**: Reviewing pull requests, providing constructive feedback, ensuring code quality and adherence to project standards.
*   **Maintainers (Committers)**: Individuals with write access to the project's main repository.
    *   **Responsibilities**: Reviewing and merging pull requests, guiding technical direction for their areas of expertise, participating in RFC discussions, upholding the Code of Conduct, and mentoring new contributors.
    *   Maintainers are typically long-term, active contributors who have shown commitment and a deep understanding of the project. New maintainers are nominated by existing maintainers and approved by the Steering Committee (or by consensus among current maintainers).
*   **Steering Committee (Post-Beta)**: Elected body responsible for overall project governance (see Section 2).
*   **Module Owners**: For larger sub-modules or plugins, specific maintainers may be designated as "owners" who have primary responsibility for that component's direction and PR approvals.

## 5. Code of Conduct

All participants in the TelaMentis community are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). The Steering Committee (or maintainers) are responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct.

## 6. Modifications to Governance

This governance model itself can be amended via an RFC process, requiring approval from the Steering Committee (or a supermajority of maintainers if the SC is not yet formed).

## 7. Financial Contributions & Sponsorship

*   Initially, TelaMentis will not actively seek financial contributions.
*   If the project grows to a point where funding is needed (e.g., for infrastructure, dedicated development, events), a clear policy for sponsorship and fund management will be established, likely in conjunction with moving to a non-profit foundation. Transparency in fund allocation will be paramount.

This governance model is a living document and will evolve with the project and its community. We are committed to building TelaMentis in an open, fair, and collaborative manner.
